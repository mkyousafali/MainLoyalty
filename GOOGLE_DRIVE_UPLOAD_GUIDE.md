# Google Drive API Integration Guide

## Overview
The Offer Advertisement Manager now includes direct Google Drive upload integration with real-time progress bars during the wizard process.

## How It Works

### 1. **Wizard Upload Flow**
- **Step 2 (Thumbnail)**: User selects image â†’ Shows upload progress â†’ Uploads to thumbnail folder
- **Step 3 (PDF)**: User selects PDF â†’ Shows upload progress â†’ Uploads to PDF folder  
- **Final Step**: Uses the uploaded Google Drive URLs to create the offer

### 2. **Upload Progress Features**
- âœ… **Real-time progress bars** with neon gradient (Green to Orange)
- âœ… **Percentage display** showing upload completion
- âœ… **Disabled navigation** during uploads to prevent interruption
- âœ… **Visual feedback** with loading animations and status messages

### 3. **Google Drive Folders**
- **Thumbnail Folder**: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XARIP5wQM4AegrAEP7oenz3ac7ZDGT2z?usp=drive_link`
- **PDF Folder**: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B8Zz52x-bR31ZiW5bZowQAU06RVq4J-e?usp=drive_link`

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… **Completed Features**
- Upload progress UI with neon-themed progress bars
- File upload state management (uploading flags)
- Wizard flow integration with upload steps
- Error handling and user feedback
- Button states during uploads (disabled/loading text)

### ðŸ”„ **Demo Mode (Current)**
- Simulated upload progress for testing
- Mock Google Drive file URLs generated
- All UI components fully functional

### ðŸŽ¯ **For Production Use**

To enable real Google Drive uploads, you'll need to:

1. **Get Google Drive API Key**
   ```javascript
   // Replace this line in the code:
   const GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
   ```

2. **Set up Google Drive API**
   - Enable Google Drive API in Google Cloud Console
   - Create service account credentials
   - Give service account access to your Google Drive folders

3. **Replace Mock Upload Function**
   The `uploadToGoogleDrive` function is currently simulated. Replace with:
   ```javascript
   async function uploadToGoogleDrive(file, folderId, onProgress) {
     // Implement real Google Drive API upload
     // with XMLHttpRequest progress tracking
   }
   ```

## User Experience

### **Upload States**
1. **File Selection**: Drag & drop interface
2. **Upload Progress**: Animated progress bar with percentage
3. **Upload Complete**: Success message and automatic next step
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with retry options

### **Visual Design**
- **Neon Progress Bars**: Green (#39FF14) to Orange (#FF6A00) gradients
- **Loading Animations**: Hourglass emoji and smooth transitions  
- **Status Messages**: Bilingual (Arabic/English) feedback
- **Disabled States**: Clear visual indication during uploads

## Database Schema
```sql
-- Offers table includes the uploaded URLs
CREATE TABLE offer_advertisements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  thumbnail_url TEXT, -- Google Drive direct link
  pdf_url TEXT,       -- Google Drive direct link
  -- ... other fields
);
```

## Next Steps
1. Run the RLS disable SQL to enable database access
2. Test the upload flow - it will show progress simulation
3. For production: Integrate real Google Drive API
4. Monitor upload success rates and user experience

The system is now ready for Google Drive integration with a polished upload experience! ðŸš€
